Description: A custom implementation of the apriori algorithm and binomial tests to identify combinations of features (genes, variants etc) significantly enriched for simultaneous mutations/events from sparse Boolean input, see Vijay Kumar Pounraja, Santhosh Girirajan (2021). Version 1.1 includes a minor adjustment to the number of combinations to be considered for multiple testing correction. This updated version is more conservative in its approach and hence more selective. <doi:10.1101/2021.10.01.462832>.
