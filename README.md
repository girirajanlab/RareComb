# RareCombÂ 
*RareComb* is a combinatorial framework that couples the apriori algorithm with binomial tests to systematically analyze patterns of rare event combinations between groups of interest to identify specific combinations that significantly associate with phenotypes. This generalizable, modular and extensible framework does not depend on apriori knowledge and can detect rare patterns from high-dimensional genetic data and generate interpretable results, making it readily useful for analyzing cohorts of all size ranges and providing a structured approach to dissect the genetic basis of complex disorders.

# Software Requirements
*RareComb* is an easy-to-use R package with five built-in user-facing functions that take a sparse Boolean dataframe as their input along with multiple input parameters to constrain the execution of these functions and the results they generate. The R package can be installed using the ***'install.packages('RareComb')'*** command and loaded into memory using the ***'library(RareComb)'*** command. *RareComb* depends on the following R packages,

> 1) arules
> 2) dplyr
> 3) pwr
> 4) reshape2
> 5) sqldf
> 6) stats
> 7) stringr
> 8) tidyr

**The five user-facing functions supported by the package along with their descriptions are as follows,**

> **1) analyze_in_out_simultaneity *(Comorbidity Analysis)*** : Analyze the relationship between input and output variables for all combinations that include at least a single output variable and meet all the input criteria specified by the user.

> **2) compare_enrichment *(Enrichment in cases + Non-enrichment in controls)*** : Quantify the enrichment in the observed frequency of cooccurring rare events in combinations that meet all the input criteria specified by the user compared to their corresponding expectation derived under the assumption of independence between the constituent elements within each combination. The function then reports the multiple-testing adjusted significant combinations in which enrichment is observed in cases but not in controls.

> **3) compare_enrichment_depletion *(Enrichment in cases + Depletion in controls)*** : Quantify the enrichment in the observed frequency of cooccurring rare events in combinations that meet all the input criteria specified by the user compared to their corresponding expectation derived under the assumption of independence between the constituent elements within each combination. The function then reports the multiple-testing adjusted significant combinations in which enrichment is observed in cases and depletion is observed in controls.

> **4) compare_enrichment_modifiers *(Must include one of the user-supplied input variables in the significant combinations)*** : Quantify the enrichment in the observed frequency of combinations that include at least one of the input variables supplied by the user as well as meet other user-specified criteria compared to their corresponding expectation derived under the assumption of independence between the constituent elements of each combination. The function then reports the combinations in which enrichment is observed in cases but not in controls.

> **5) compare_expected_vs_observed *(Compare observed frequency with the expected frequency within a single group)*** : Compare the observed frequency of combinations
that meet all the user-specified criteria with their corresponding expectation derived under the assumption of independence between the constituent elements of each combination. Unlike the method 'compare_enrichment', this method does NOT split the groups based on phenotypes. It simply treats the entire input as a single cohort and measures the magnitude of difference between the expected and observed frequencies of cooccurring events.




# Running *RareComb*
**Running *RareComb* involves the following considerations and steps,**

**Things to consider:**
> **1) Make sure the input variables in the input data are prefixed with 'Input_' and the output/outcome variables are prefixed with 'Output_'. If you prefer a different convention, please use the optional parameters 'input_format' and 'output_format' to specify the prefix of your choice**

> **2) Prior to invoking the function 'analyze_in_out_simultaneity', make sure the input file has more than one output/outcome variables**

> **3) Prior to invoking the functions 'compare_enrichment', 'compare_enrichment_depletion' and 'compare_enrichment_modifiers', make sure the input file has EXACTLY one output/outcome variable**


**Steps involved in running the functions in *RareComb*:**
> **Step 1) Generate an input Boolean dataframe with 'n' samples (rows) and 'p' variables (columns).**

> **Step 2) Invoke the function of interest using the input file along with the additional mandatory and optional parameters.**

> **Step 3) The final output returned by all the functions is a dataframe that the users can choose save to an output comma or tab separated file.**

# Output files and columns
Each function returns a dataframe with the list of statistically significant combinations that meet the user-specified input criteria as the output. Since the definition of 'statistical significance' is defined differently for each function, the number and types of columns in the output file will vary for each function depending on the size of the requested combination, number of groups under analysis, if the supporting sample names are requested or not etc. For example, for functions that analyze the data based on a single binary outcome (Case/Control), the output file will contain frequency of individual and cooccurring events in each group separately, whereas the output file from analyzing multiple phenotypes together will only contain frequencies from the single group that is being analyzed. A list of output column names for each of the five functions along with their descriptions are provided below,
